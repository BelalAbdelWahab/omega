# About Omega Framework

    Omega Framework is a post exploitation framework, aiming to provide 
    a stealth interactive shell-like connection over HTTP between client 
    and web server. It is a powerful framework capable to maintain access 
    to a compromised web server for privilege escalation purposes.
