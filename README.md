# About Omega Framework

    Omega Framework is a PHP post-exploitation framework, 
    aiming to provide a stealth interactive shell-like connection 
    over HTTP between client and web server using only a simple PHP 
    payload. It is a powerful framework capable to maintain access 
    to a compromised web server for privilege escalation purposes.
